I don’t think I chose software development, so much as it chose me, yes that sounds very cliche’.  I’m 54 years old and starting a new exciting adventure in my life.  Throughout my career, I’ve realized that I loved to create and build things,  it has brought out real passion.  Thus, I have stumbled upon software development, where I can use my creative desires.  
For the past year, I have been a very amateur coder. I’ve always been interested, but never took a leap of faith into programming. My introduction to programming was during my first year of graduate school at The University of Hawaii in the late eighties, using SAS (Statistical Analysis System) on a mainframe IBM computer that filled up an entire room.  During this time a mouse has yet to be created, and it took 10 minutes to boot up my Toshiba T100 laptop.  Being a self-taught person I started to teach myself.  I’ve done online courses at Codecademy, watched tutorial videos on Udemy, and worked on small and easy web projects for my current job.
For the last couple months, I’ve been preparing myself to absorb and learn as much as I can. But there’s only so much you can do by yourself at home in front of your computer,  with no friends or colleagues who are in the field to help out, and no one to turn to. I needed help and something structured and geared towards learning. I ended up enrolling in Flatiron School’s online by researching other programs. But the free online bootcamp prep courses convinced me that I had found what I was looking for,  and now I’m on my way.  It’s all about creating from scratch, constant change, frustration, “bugs,” joys, pains and love of coding.
